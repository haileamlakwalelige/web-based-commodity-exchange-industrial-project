# web-based-commodity-exchange-industrial-project

## Overall 
Our final year project centered around the development of a web-based commodity exchange. To bring this project to fruition, we utilized a variety of tools and technologies, including Laravel, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a team, we took great care to ensure that both the documentation and the code were of the highest quality, dedicating ourselves to delivering a polished and well-executed project.

## Description
To enhance the overall clarity of our project, we made the strategic decision to separate the documentation and the code. By presenting the documentation first, we were able to provide a clear and comprehensive explanation of the project's objectives, requirements, and design. This approach helped us to ensure that our stakeholders had a complete understanding of the project before delving into the code, resulting in a more streamlined and effective development process
